# Robotics
This course is special for taching children about arduino and its deffrent compenents, I use this presentations to teach children between the age of 8 to 16

you find in this course:

  1- basics about electronics and electrical circuits\n
  2- basics about the arduino bord digital and analog signals
  3- PWM pulse width modulation 
  4- how to implement the LDR and potensiometer in simple projects
  5- Ultrasonic sensor and how to calculate the distance
  6- DC motors, how its works and its implementation.
  7- Buetooth module, FTDI,USB, UART, How cand data be transmited from PC to arduino 
  6- MPU6050, gyroscope, accelerometer and how to get data from this module
  
due to lack of time I'll try to add more sensors to this course, wait for me soon....!!!
